## Running dev env
* Install docker
* Install .net core sdk 
* run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up`
* start PrivatePond project through launch settings profile
* The dev encironment is configured to have 3 wallets:
* 2 wallets are single-signature hot wallets, configured to receive deposits to. 
* 1 wallet is a multi-sig cold wallet, configured to receive funds when the hot wallets are "overflowing"


## Running whole stack in docker
* `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-run-locally.yml build --no-cache`
* `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-run-locally.yml up`
* should become available at localhost:5000 
* You can view API docs at localhost:5000/swagger

## Helpers
* You can emulate new blocks by alling the `docker-bitcoin-generate.sh` pr `.ps1` files. `docker-bitcoin-generate.sh 6` generates 6 blocks for example
* You can use the bitcoin-cli sh/ps1 scripts to test sending funds.
